<!-- Explanation of New Meta Tags:

Open Graph (og:) Tags: These are part of the Open Graph protocol and are primarily used by social media platforms (like Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) to display rich snippets when your page is shared.

og:type: Defines the type of content (e.g., website, article, video.movie).

og:url: The canonical URL of the page.

og:title: The title that appears in the social media share.

og:description: The description that appears in the social media share.

og:image: The URL of an image that will be displayed in the social media share. Make sure this image is high quality and relevant.

og:image:width and og:image:height: Specify the dimensions of the og:image for better rendering on social platforms.

Twitter (twitter:) Tags: These are specific to Twitter Cards and control how your content is displayed when linked on Twitter.

twitter:card: The type of Twitter card (e.g., summary, summary_large_image, app, player). summary_large_image is often preferred for a more prominent visual.

twitter:url: The canonical URL of the page.

twitter:title: The title for the Twitter Card.

twitter:description: The description for the Twitter Card.

twitter:image: The URL of an image to be displayed in the Twitter Card.

Canonical Tag (<link rel="canonical">):

This is extremely important for SEO. It tells search engines which version of a URL is the "master" version if you have multiple URLs that serve the same or very similar content (e.g., www.example.com/page and example.com/page). This prevents duplicate content penalties. Replace https://www.yourwebsite.com/ with the actual canonical URL for that specific page.

Robots Meta Tag (<meta name="robots">):

This tag instructs search engine crawlers on how to index and follow links on your page.

index, follow: Default and most common. Tells crawlers to index the page and follow all links on it.

noindex: Tells crawlers NOT to index the page (it won't appear in search results).

nofollow: Tells crawlers NOT to follow any links on the page.

You usually don't need to explicitly state index, follow as it's the default, but it doesn't hurt.

Keywords Meta Tag (<meta name="keywords">):

While historically very important, its influence on modern SEO (especially for Google) is very low. Search engines are much better at understanding content contextually. However, some smaller search engines might still use it, and it can serve as a simple list of your target terms.

Remember to replace the placeholder URLs (https://www.yourwebsite.com/ and image paths) with your actual website and image URLs. -->
